 ### a silly project to make a two button keyboard, blown way past the brief with unneeded features, schematics, 3d print files, and detailed 3d renders.

 ## Why?
 Great Question! 
 I started this project by making a programmable key, the OneKey, as a way to put my programming learning into something tangible. The tukii spawned from it hellish corpse, 
 and my friends and family have allowed this sickness to continue unimpeaded. 

 Starting in Circuit Python, the tukii was feature rich but sluggish and un responsive. Switching to a complete rewrite was the most obvious and time intensive solution I 
 could find.

 The tukii will grow and improve. It is inevitable. There is nothing you can do. It has already started.
 
 ## Components
 Waveshare RP2040 ZERO <br>
 EC11 Rotary Encoder <br>
 Mechanical Switch x 2<br>
 0.96" OLED SSD1306<br>
 <br><br>
 The schematic is easy to reproduce, and features easily sourced components. <br>

## Compile and Install
Use the Arduino IDE, using the libraries listed at the top of the .ino file.

## Case
The case, buttons, and dial are all 3d printed. files are included.
